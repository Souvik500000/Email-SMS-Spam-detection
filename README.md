# Email-SMS-Spam-detection

# Spam Detection Project

This project is aimed at developing a spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify emails or messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) accurately.

## Background

Spam emails and messages have become a significant issue in today's digital world. This project tackles this problem by building a spam detection system using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the content and patterns of messages, the system can effectively identify and classify spam messages, helping users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful content.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the [Data](#data) section.
2. Train the spam detection model by running the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new messages. See the following example:

   ```python
   from spam_detector import SpamDetector

   detector = SpamDetector()
   message = "Buy cheap Viagra now!"
   result = detector.predict(message)
   print(result)  # Output: "spam"
   ```

Feel free to customize and extend the project to suit your specific needs!

## Data

The project uses a publicly available dataset for training and evaluation purposes. The dataset consists of labeled messages, where each message is classified as either spam or ham. You can find the dataset at [link-to-dataset](https://example.com/dataset).

To use your own dataset, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a CSV file with two columns: "message" and "label". The "message" column contains the text of each message, and the "label" column indicates whether the message is spam or ham.
2. Place the CSV file in the `data` directory.

## Model

The spam detection model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically employing a [describe the model or algorithms used]. The model is trained on the provided dataset to learn the patterns and characteristics of spam and non-spam messages.

For more details about the model architecture and implementation, refer to the `model.ipynb` notebook in the repository.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the spam detection model, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the model in correctly classifying spam and non-spam messages.

For more detailed evaluation results, refer to the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook in the repository.
